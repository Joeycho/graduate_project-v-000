# supervised_learning-v-000
Supervised learning with TensorFlow libraries.

The technique which was used in this folder, is called `Supervised Learning`.

- In the `Supervised Learning`, several models could be used and trained.
- Each element in data consists of ratings per each shop and the final selection from pet owner. 
- The range of rating could be from 0 to `the given number`, and for the final selection, it will be one of integers, inclusive from 0 to 4. For example, when the number of shops is 5, and the range is 10, a possible element would be [5,6,4,3,7,4].
