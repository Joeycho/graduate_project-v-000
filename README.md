# graduate_project-v-000
Test machine learning techniques with TensorFlow libraries.

Current one is from tutorials in Tensorflow, to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network.

The technique is called `Supervised Learning`.

- In the `Supervised Learning`, several models would be used and trained.
- Each row in data consists of 5 ratings per each shop and the final selection from pet owner, such as [5,6,4,3,7,4]
- The range of rating is from 0 to 10, and for the final selection, it will be one of integers, inclusive from 0 to 4.
