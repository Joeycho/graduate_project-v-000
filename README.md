# graduate_project-v-000
Test machine learning techniques with TensorFlow libraries.

Current one in this folder is from tutorials in Tensorflow, to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network.

The other one is called the `Supervised_Learning-v-000` folder. The description and instruction are written on the `README.md` file in the folder.

## Instruction

To initiate this project, type in the terminal as the below.

`git clone git@github.com:Joeycho/graduate_project-v-000.git`

Currently, to open the webpage, type the direct path of `index.html`file in the browser possibly only worked in Firefox.

In chrome, it has error message.

`Access to Script at 'file:///.../graduate_project-v-000/script.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Invalid response. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.`

From a tutorial guide, it is recommended to install http-server instead to run the server.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
`npm install http-server -g`

In addition, it is required to clear cached image and files and cookies from Chrome browser.
